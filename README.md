Pokemon Battle simulator
This website is going to have a center window where you can play a turn based pokemon battle. All the data and statistics of the pokemon will be pulled from the https://pokeapi.co/ api.

    * The user is first prompted to pick a pokemon among a handful of pokemon shown on the screen.  
    * After selecting a pokemon. Your pokemon and a randomly selected pokemon will now enter a turn based battle between each other.  
    * On each turn the player can select between 4 different moves that will affect the enemy pokemon. (dealing damage or weaken enemy pokemon)  
    * The enemy pokemon on his turn will select a random move on his turn (to simulate an AI playing)  
    * This repeats until your or the computer pokemon's hp goes to 0.  
    * The player either wins or loses, and gets the choice to play again.
