# Pokemon-Battle-Emulator
Pokemon Battle simulator
This website is going to have a game window in the center which you can press to play. All the data and statistics of the pokemon will be pulled from the https://pokeapi.co/ api.

The user starts the game, and selects a pokemon and the game starts
Then the user plays a move with his pokemon against the computer's pokemon and does some damage or effect
Then the computer makes a move with his pokemon (likely to be random)
This repeats until your or the computer pokemon “faints” and the game ends
The player either wins or loses, and gets the choice to play again
