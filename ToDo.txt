effects I should code 
    1. conditions
    2. flinch
    3. weather
    4. forced repeat move
    5. delayed moves/effects

things I can fix but i simply don't think it is worth the effort
    1. the double crit bug (triggered when recalculating damage)
    2. overkill damage should not account for recoil and life Steal
